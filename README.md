# Project Name

redux-feedback-loop

## Description

This app takes in input from 4 component routes and stores them in a reducer to be posted to a database. On the click of the 'Next' button on the 4 input pages, the inputs are cleared and the information is stored in the reducer for later use. The review page shows the information entered from the previous pages and upon submit, the reducer clears and the info is posted into the database.

The admin page allows the feedback responses from the database to be viewed and deleted.
